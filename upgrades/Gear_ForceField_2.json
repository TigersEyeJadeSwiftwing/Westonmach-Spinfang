It doesn't interfere with any operation of any weapons or other gear or equipment of a 'Mech when it is active.  Only one of these bad boys can work in a 'Mech at a time though, so install just one of the best one you can get your hands on for best results.  Spinfang force fields are expensive, yet worth it according to popular opinion.",
