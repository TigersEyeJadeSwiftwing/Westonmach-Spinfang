They run and even walk large distances at once, with speed.  If you want a mech that will really race out to kill something in little time, this is it.  The 7A variant is all about ultra lasers, EIGHT of them, plus some machine guns that increase pain and hurt when getting up close to this 'Mech.  It has a weakness in that it lacks any coolant plant, so it has limited heat-shedding ability, but in cold weather terrain it is truly deadly as it can afford the heat from firing more of it's lasers at a time.  Oh, and don't forget it also has sort-range missles to worry about too.",
