The frame and chassis is redesigned to be lighter weight and support more tonnage.  Weapon support is a little bit improved as well.  This specific variant is designed for fighting, with a pair of large lasers on the same arm as a pair of Rager buckshot cannons.  It also has a medium laser for backup, small lasers for fighting infantry, and a mega cluster heat sink for shedding heat.  It has potential for fighting enemies at a medium-far distance as well as up-close and personal.  This battlemech doesn't however take much of a beating like larger 'Mechs would.
