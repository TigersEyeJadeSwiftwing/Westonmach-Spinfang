        "Details" : "    Born in a middle-class merchant family from the Draconis Combine, Matthew Angler grew up, though only part-way, with rather strict and harsh parents and schoolteachers who demanded discipline, respect, and honor, which were things which Matt really didn't have.  Rebellious and uncouth, Matt developed an attitude toward authority, one that came with an offensive gesture and cry of \"Hey, talk to the finger, pal!\"  He would face punishment quite often from parents and schoolteachers.  Despite this, he actually did quite well when it came to schoolwork and getting good grades in his classes.  When he did behave, he actually made a very good junior battlemech mechanic, who eventually proved that he could test drive a battlemech he worked on without supervision, and test fire it's weapons on a range with a somewhat decent skill, one that comes with someone who at least somewhat knows what he's doing piloting such a vehicle of war.\n    Matt continued to have potential, but also continued to be an unreliable pain in the rear end for his teachers and parents, and when he was 15 years old his parents were unhappy about him getting in trouble with schoolteachers at school, and Matt's father decided that he had put with enough and demanded that Matt leave home and never come back, no longer his son.  Matt go no sympathy from his mother, who was also furious.  Lonely, angry, and suddenly scared stiff, Matt gathered his things, and left with a friend of his from school.  His friend's family could not adopt him, but set him up with a local mercenary group of battlemech pilots that needed a mechanic, knowing they most likely would never see Matthew ever again, but hoping for the best for him.\n    Being at least halfway decent a mechanic and novice 'mech pilot, though still young and not fully grown up, Matt got passed around, more like \"kicked around\", from one mercenary group to another, until finally he ended up being in Yang's hands of all things.  Yang found that Matt, only 16 years old, was actually very obedient, or at least tried to be, though only because he was scared stiff into being so, uncertain of where he might end up if he screwed up again.  When given a little breathing room, Yang found that Matt was actually a capable mechanic, but actually better and more capable as a test driver who could also test fire newly installed weaponry better than some could.  Yang decided to give young teenage Matt a special break, and said \"I think you would be better off being a battlemech pilot pilot than a mechanic.  I'm going to put you on the roster and get you hooked up with a bunk in one of their rooms, kid.\"\n    Still only 16, Matt is no longer a mechanic, isn't quite an adult, and is now with the 'mech pilots on-board the ship, moved over from being one of the MechTechs with a lot of room to grow and learn.  Uncertain, Matt is a bit rough around the edges, but loyal as he wants to never repeat his mistakes and do himself in all over again, terrified at the idea of ending up kicked out and fending for himself in a city's streets planetside somewhere, in a lifestyle he doesn't know how to survive in.  Regardless, he is intelligent, and still retains his ability to get good grades in a classroom, still retaining what got him into honors classes when he had a family.",
