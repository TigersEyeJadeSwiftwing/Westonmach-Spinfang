        "Details" : "    When Jeff Vendler was a young boy, he was told that he had a magic dragon's face, and wasn't like normal human beings, but very special and very magical, and it was in his blood, his DNA, and nature.  Interestingly enough, he has perfect and unblemished skin, and always able to heal and regrow without scars, marks, loose freckles, or even show signs of aging.  His family doctor said that his body wouldn't age past that of a teenager, and that his mind wouldn't develop maturity past that of a 19-year old boy, and retain life-long adolescence, though he would continue to be very bright and intelligent, as well as intellectual, while increasingly gaining experience and know-how as well as social skills past that of most human beings, though still that of a teenage adolescent.  He would live about five times as long as a normal person and human being, youthful throughout all of it, due to how special he was.  He was also told he would enjoy superhuman physical strength and reflexes, and never grow old as he lived.\n    As he grew up, he found that what he was told was right.  He made many of his schoolmates jealous, though he found he could also make friends easily with them left and right.  He found he was very good at action video games, sports, and of all things, sword-fighting.  He found that he never developed scars or injuries from anything he got into, and although he could be hurt and even crushed as easily as any other teenage boy, a bit more than most actually with his thin and skinny body and frame, he always healed completely, still youthful and good as new afterwards, like magic as his friends would say, and literally no permanent damage to himself.  He lost a hand from swordfighting when he was 14 years old, which he left behind with a care-free shrug in the outdoor mud and grass outside the back of his parent's well-to-do estate where he grew up, and, thanks to his body's nature, his genetics, and what his friends swore was the magic in his blood, he grew a new hand which was actually better than his old one, slightly faster, stronger, and having better dexterity and reflexes than his old one, which he broke in and was playing video games with by the time dinner that very evening was ready.  His friends were surprised that he had no scars, aches or pain afterwards, and that when it was first severed he felt no physical pain.  His parents allowed him to continue to swordfight as a hobby.\n    When he was 16 years old, he stood up to a bully at his private high school who was wielding a knife by grabbing the knife out of the bully's hand and then grabbing his head by the top of his hair with one hand to hold his head, then actually decapitating himself in front of the bully with the knife, then holding his own severed head up in the air with his one hand gripping his head by his hair, smiling and taunting the bully, daring him to take him on after demonstrating that having his own head cut off wouldn't stop him.  The bully freaked out and somehow wasn't interested in hurting Jeff or stealing his wallet anymore.  Friends of Jeff and fellow schoolmates whooped and cheered in their support of Jeff.  Jeff then carried his severed head around with him in his hands the rest of that day, and admitted he actually wasn't sure if he would have a way to re-attach it or not, but didn't seem fazed or worried about it, saying he guessed he would figure something out.  The next day, he showed up at school with his head back on his neck, and no scars or signs of injury, telling classmates that he \"figured it out\", whatever that meant.  When one of his friends asked him exactly how he got his head back on, he smiled, shook his head, and said \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\"\n    Aside from his other adventures of his youth, Jeff eventually graduated high school and moved out of his wealthy parent's home to go study under a private pair of mentors to be a battlemech pilot, and developed substantial skill very quickly.  His teachers said he had a lot of potential, and then gave up after a while, saying that they could not teach Jeff any further as his skills surpassed their own.\n    Jeff then took a rather serious amount of money his parents gave him, telling him that they loved him and would support him doing whatever he wanted to as a battlemech pilot, when he explained to his father that being a freelancing or mercenary battlemech pilot was what he wanted to do with his life, even though he had an interest in doing so for an empire's military but didn't exactly want a soldier's life.\n    Now at the current age of 152, yet still a 16 year-old teenager with a 19 year-old mind and years of experience and memories, and with a large fortune he inherited even though leaving half of it to his older brother who already passed away as an elderly great-grandfather, he continues to work as a mercenary battlemech pilot, and a rather darn good one.",
