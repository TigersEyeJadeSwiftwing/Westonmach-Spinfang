Ammo Bins for most weapons will normally explode and destroy their installed location when they receive a Critical Hit.\n\nViper Rocket 5x Ammo Bins each contain 400 Viper rockets and may feed multiple weapons, which don't have to be installed in the same locations.  As with any ammunition bins, internal mechanisms feed ammunition throughout the inside of a 'Mech to any weapon that uses the ammunition.  Viper rockets are compact and lightweight thanks to being built with custom high-tech materials, and have engines, fuel, and warheads that are inert and non-explosive when not in use and stored in ammunition containers, even if armed, as well as during flight, until the warhead is triggered with contact with the target.  As such, their ammo bins won't explode with a critical hit.  Viper rockets are smaller than SRM and LRM missles.",
