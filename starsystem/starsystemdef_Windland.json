        "Details": "Being one of two remote 'island' worlds of the Federated Suns located right next to each other, Windland is a dry, arid Earth-sized world that has little vegetation or water except at the poles, where it is frozen.  The planet is however terraformed, so it's small population that mostly works in mines and factories enjoy breathable air and Earth-origin outdoor trees and wildlife, in places where it isn't too dry and barren.  Pirates are also here, in small groups, which maintain black market locations, yet can't organize well enough to offer any contracts for mercenaries.  Rather, House Davion, which owns Windland, offers contracts for hunting the pirates, although the pirate presence here is quite lightweight and sparse.  Windland doesn't have much as far as agriculture, as there is next to no water here, but the planet does export and sell a number of goods of kinds, supplied by and based upon what it digs up in it's many mines and what it makes in it's factories.  The small population that lives here is a bit wealthy from such business.  Unlike Windland's neighbor Wynsprach, Windland doesn't support tourism or sight-seeing, but it does sell a bit in it's stores.",
