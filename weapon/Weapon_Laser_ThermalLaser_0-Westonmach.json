        "Details" : "Thermal Lasers do no damage but fry their target with melting heat.  Like other lasers, thermal lasers enjoy a baseline accuracy bonus over other weapons.  Small thermal lasers are very short-range antipersonnel weapons, yet are also good at overheating an enemy battlemech to paralyze it and force it to shut down, especially when one is close enough for battlemech melee combat.  Thermal lasers by Westonmach are manufactured with non-metallic 31st century high-tech polymer materials that are far lighter than any metal while at the same time being much stronger and more rugged than thick hard steel and other metals.  Only Westonmach knows how to and has the capability to manufacture, mold, and forge such materials and products made out of them.  No one who has tried has ever been able to reverse engineer such materials or products.  Such products are lightweight and tough, as well as compact, although they can still generate heat in a battlemech.  Regarding this product, small thermal lasers don't add any significant tonnage to a battlemech they are installed on.  Some variants of small thermal lasers have upgraded internal components and burn and melt a target better, doing more heat damage to a target battlemech.",
