        "Details" : "Joltex Cannons shoot streams of paramatter generated by an internal energy-to-paramatter process, which form globs of a 'soup' of sharp fragments in a violently swirling pseudo-liquid, which rip and shred whatever they collide with, before quickly degenerating and dissapating into nothingness after any damage is done.  Unlike a shotgun firing buckshot, the fragments do not spread out when fired, but stay concentrated together, and either hit or miss their target.  The impact of a ball of this paramatter soup will do some stability damage, and can in some cases knock a 'Mech over, but the real danger to the target is the swirling fragment shards that rip apart armor and can cause extensive damage to components.  Joltex cannons, especially the basic models, are not extremely accurate, but still useful.",
